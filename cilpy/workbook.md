# Project specification
## General description
Develop a new computational intelligence library guided by high-level but
practical software design principles.  
The library will focus on nature-ispired optimization algorithms and the tools
related to those algorithms.

## Requirements
 * The library MUST be written in Python.
 * The library MUST implement and allow for the implementation of:
   - single-solution problems,
   - single-objective problems,
   - static objective functions,
   - dynamic objective functions,
   - boundary constrained problems,
   - constrained problems,
   - single-popluation algorithms
 * The library SHOULD allow for the implementation of
   - multi-solution problems,
   - multi- and many-objective problems,
   - multi-population algorithms,
   - hyper-heuristic algorithms
