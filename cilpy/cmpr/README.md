# `cilpy.cmpr`
The `cmpr` component of `cilpy` is used to compare solutions, built with `psol`,
to optimization problems generated by `pgen`.

# Comparing solutions
Initially, the library will rely on
[other tools](https://github.com/yesteryearer/Automated-Analysis-of-Metaheuristics)
to compare solutions.
