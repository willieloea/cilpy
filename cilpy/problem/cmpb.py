    """An implementation of the Constrained Moving Peaks Benchmark (CMPB).

    This class generates a dynamic constrained optimization problem by composing
    two independent `MovingPeaksBenchmark` instances: one for the objective
    function landscape (`f`) and one for the constraint landscape (`g`).

    The problem is naturally a maximization problem defined as:
    Maximize: h(x) = f(x) - g(x)
    A solution is considered feasible if h(x) >= 0 (i.e., f(x) >= g(x)).

    To align with standard minimization solvers, this class formulates the
    problem as:
    Minimize: g(x) - f(x)
    Subject to: g(x) - f(x) <= 0

    This formulation correctly models the problem, where the objective function
    and the single inequality constraint are the same.

            function landscape.
