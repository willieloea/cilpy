"""The problem module: Defines the optimization problem interface.

This module provides the abstract "contract" for all optimization problems
within the `cilpy` library. It consists of two main components:

1. `Evaluation`: A dataclass that standardizes the return value from any problem
   evaluation, capturing fitness and constraint information.
2. `Problem`: An abstract base class that defines the required methods and
   attributes for a problem to be compatible with `cilpy` solvers.

By implementing the `Problem` interface, users can define custom optimization
landscapes that any solver in the library can operate on.

    This dataclass standardizes the output of a problem's `evaluate` method,
    providing a consistent structure for fitness values and constraint
    violations that all `cilpy` solvers can understand.

    Attributes:
        fitness: The objective function value(s) of the solution.
            This can be a single float for single-objective problems or a list
            of floats for multi-objective problems.
        constraints_inequality: A list of values for inequality
            constraints. For a constraint `g(x) <= 0`, a positive value
            indicates a violation. `None` if the problem has no inequality
            constraints.
        constraints_equality: A list of values for equality
            constraints. For a constraint `h(x) == 0`, any non-zero value
            indicates a violation. `None` if the problem has no equality
            constraints.

    Example:
        .. code-block:: python
