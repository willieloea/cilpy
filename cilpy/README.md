# `cilpy`
The Compuational Intelligence Library for Python (`cilpy`) is a computational
intelligence library written in Python to ease the process of conducting
experiments on nature-inspired algorithms (NIAs) for constrained optimization
problems and multi-objective optimization problems.

The `cilpy` library consists of three components:
 1. A problem generation component (`cilpy.problem`)
 2. A problem solving component (`cilpy.solver`)
 3. A solution comparison component (`cilpy.compare`)

If a user implements the interface defined for each of these components, `cilpy`
can run an experiment, saving effort in studying NIAs.

## `cilpy` components
### `cilpy.problem`
The `cilpy.problem` component is used to generate optimization problems for the
`cilpy.solver` and `cilpy.compare` components.

Currently (2025) `cilpy` should allow for the creation of:
 * Constrained Optimization Problems (COPs)
 * Multi-Objective Optimization Problems (MOOPs)

#### Constrained Optimization Problems
There are many ways in which constrained optimization problems (COPs) can be
categorized, but for now `cilpy.problem` categorizes COPs by whether constraints
are static or dynamic, and whether the objective function is static or dynamic.
Thus the following problem categories exist:
 * static constrained static optimization problems (SCSO),
 * static constrained dynamic optimization problems (SCDO),
 * dynamic constrained static optimization problems (DCSO), and
 * dynamic constrained dynamic optimization problems (DCDO).

#### Multi-Objective Optimization Problems
TODO

### `cilpy.solver`
The `cilpy.solver` component is used to solve optimization problems generated by
`cilpy.problem`, and produces output so that `cilpy.compare` can compare
different algorithms.

### `cilpy.compare`
The `cilpy.compare` component is used to compare algorithms defined by
`cilpy.solver` on problems generated by `cilpy.problem`.

#### Comparing solutions
Initially, the library will rely on
[other tools](https://github.com/yesteryearer/Automated-Analysis-of-Metaheuristics)
to compare solutions.
