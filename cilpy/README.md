# `cilpy`

## Project specification
### General description
Develop a new computational intelligence library guided by high-level but
practical software design principles.
The library will focus on nature-ispired optimization algorithms and the tools
related to those algorithms.

### Requirements
 * The library MUST be written in Python.
 * The library MUST implement and allow for the implementation of:
   - single-solution problems,
   - single-objective problems,
   - static objective functions,
   - dynamic objective functions,
   - boundary constrained problems,
   - constrained problems,
   - single-popluation algorithms
 * The library SHOULD allow for the implementation of
   - multi-solution problems,
   - multi- and many-objective problems,
   - multi-population algorithms,
   - hyper-heuristic algorithms


## `cilpy` components
The `cilpy` library consists of three components:
 1. A problem generation component (`cilpy.pgen`)
 2. A problem solving component (`cilpy.psol`)
 3. A solution comparison component (`cilpy.cmpr`)

### `cilpy.pgen`
The `pgen` component of `cilpy` is used to generate optimization problems which
can be used to generate optimization problems for the `psol` and `cmpr`
components of `cilpy`.

#### Optimization problems
##### Constrained optimization problems
There are many ways in which constrained optimization problems (COPs) can be
categorized, but for now `cilpy.pgen` categorizes COPs by whether constraints
are static or dynamic, and whether the objective function is static or dynamic.
Thus the following problem categories exist:
 * static constrained static optimization problems (SCSO),
 * static constrained dynamic optimization problems (SCDO),
 * dynamic constrained static optimization problems (DCSO), and
 * dynamic constrained dynamic optimization problems (DCDO).

### `cilpy.psol`
The `psol` component of `cilpy` is used to solve optimization problems generated
by `cilpy.pgen`, and then produce output so that `cilpy.cmpr` can compare
different solutions.

### `cilpy.cmpr`
The `cmpr` component of `cilpy` is used to compare solutions, built with `psol`,
to optimization problems generated by `pgen`.

#### Comparing solutions
Initially, the library will rely on
[other tools](https://github.com/yesteryearer/Automated-Analysis-of-Metaheuristics)
to compare solutions.
