"""The solver module: Defines the optimization algorithm interface.

This module provides the abstract "contract" for all optimization algorithms
(solvers) within the `cilpy` library.

The core component is the `Solver` abstract base class. Any algorithm that
inherits from this class and implements its methods can be used by the
`ExperimentRunner` to solve any `cilpy` problem.

    This class is the blueprint for all optimization algorithms in `cilpy`. To
    create a new solver, inherit from this class and implement its abstract
    methods. The interface is generic to support different solution types
    (e.g., `List[float]`, `np.ndarray`) and fitness structures.

    Attributes:
        problem (cilpy.problem.Problem): The problem instance that the solver is
            optimizing.
        name (str): The name of the solver instance.
        comparator (cilpy.solver.chm.ConstraintHandler): The constraint-handling
            comparator used to comparesolutions.

        A minimal implementation for a Random Search solver.
