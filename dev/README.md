# About
The goal of this directory is to aid developers of the library. It is a place
where contribution rules and guides are given, plans are stored, and progress is
monitored.

**Directory Outline**:
`CONTRIBUTING.md` contains rules for contributing to the project (things
like code style).  
`plan.md` describes what is currently being worked on in the library.
