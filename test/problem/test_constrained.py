"""
Unit tests for single-objective, constrained optimization problems.

This test suite is designed to be generic. To test a new constrained problem,
simply add its class to the `CONSTRAINED_PROBLEMS` list.
The `pytest.mark.parametrize` decorator will automatically run all defined
tests for the new problem, ensuring it adheres to the expected interface
and behavior.
