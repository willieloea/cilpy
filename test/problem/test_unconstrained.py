"""
Unit tests for single-objective, unconstrained optimization problems.

This test suite is designed to be generic. To test a new unconstrained
problem, simply add its class to the `UNCONSTRAINED_PROBLEMS` list.
The `pytest.mark.parametrize` decorator will automatically run all defined
tests for the new problem, ensuring it adheres to the expected interface
and behavior.
