# `cilpy` (Compuational Intelligence Library for Python)
`cilpy` is a computational intelligence library written in Python. 
The library focuses on nature-inspired optimization algorithms and the tools related to those algorithms.

## Repo Outline
`cilpy/` contains the library
`docs/` contains documentation for the library
`examples/` contains examples on how to use the library
`test/` contains tests for the library

## Design Principles:
 * Genericity
    * Problems: single-solution, multi-solution
    * Objectives: single objectives, multi- and many-objectives, static objective functions, dynamically changing search landscapes,
    * Constraints: boundary constrained and constrained problems,
    * Population: single population and multi-population algorithms, and 
    * hyper-heuristic algorithms
 * Extendability (abstract base classes)
 * Maintainability (good software engineering practices)
