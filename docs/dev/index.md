The `cilpy` library is broken into three components:
 - problem
 - solver
 - comparison

Python files must follow Google-Style Docstrings.

Prefixes used for denoting branch purposes are as follows:
* `ft` - feature - feature development
* `fx/` – fix - bug fixes
* `ch/` – chore - maintenance tasks
* `rf/` - refactor – internal code improvements
* `hf/` – hotfix - urgent production fixes
* `ts/` – test - testing related branches
