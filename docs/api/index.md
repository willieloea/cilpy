# API Reference

The `cilpy` API is designed for extensibility. By implementing these core abstract classes, your custom components will integrate seamlessly with the library's ecosystem.

## Problem API

The `Problem` interface is the standard for defining optimization problems. Any class that inherits from `cilpy.problem.Problem` can be passed to any `cilpy` solver.

**Key Responsibilities:**
*   Define the search space (dimensionality and bounds).
*   Implement the `evaluate()` method, which takes a candidate solution and returns its fitness and constraint violations.
*   Indicate whether the problem is dynamic via the `is_dynamic()` method.

## Solver API

The `Solver` interface is the standard for implementing optimization algorithms. Any class that inherits from `cilpy.solver.Solver` can be used by the `ExperimentRunner` to solve any `cilpy` problem.

**Key Responsibilities:**
*   Accept a `Problem` object during initialization.
*   Implement the `step()` method, which executes a single iteration or generation of the algorithm.
*   Implement the `get_result()` method, which returns the best solution(s) found by the solver.

## Compare API

*(This component is under development.)*

The `Compare` interface will provide a standard for creating tools that analyze and visualize experiment results.

**Key Responsibilities:**
*   Process output data generated by the `ExperimentRunner`.
*   Perform statistical comparisons between solver performances.
*   Generate plots and tables to summarize results.
